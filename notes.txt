--Processing Images inside XML--

Letâ€™s say we have XML invoice has an image tag like this:
<img src="/path/to/logo.png"/>

During the transformation process reConvertToBase64:
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS..."/>

Now the image is fully embedded within the HTML and will display correctly, 
even if the HTML is shared via email or on a web page.
